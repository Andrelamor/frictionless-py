Welcome to Tabular Validator's documentation!
=============================================

Tabular Validator is a pipeline interface for validating tabular data.

A **data source** is passed through a pipeline of **validators**.

Optionally, the data source is **transformed** as it passes through the pipeline.

In return, the client receives a **report** on validations performed.


Design goals
============

High-level design goals for Tabular Validator:

* Validate tabular data in CSV and JSON formats
* Provide a suite of small tools that each implement a type of validation to run
* Provide a pipeline API for registering built-in and custom validators
* Components should be easily usable in 3rd party (Python) code


Current status
==============

The suite of tools is current under development.
